This repository contains a COBOL program demonstrating a runtime error that can occur when using the LENGTH function to calculate the length of a string. The program allocates insufficient space for the result of the LENGTH function, leading to a runtime error.  The solution demonstrates how to correct this error by ensuring the receiving numeric variable has enough space to accommodate the result.  This is a common issue in older COBOL systems or when dealing with unusually long strings.
